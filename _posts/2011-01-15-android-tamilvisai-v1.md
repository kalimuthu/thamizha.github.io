Thamizha Team is happy to release TamilVisai 0.1 for Android on this Tamil New year & Pongal day.  Android TamilVisai is an opensource Tamil keyboard manager which can be used to type tamil text in Android OS.

After about months of development by our team member Jegadeesan, TamilVisai 0.1 is ready for public use. This is availabe in Android Market from this Tamil New year day. Its developed as a free software under GPL V3 license.

Here are the main features supported in this version:
* It can input tamil in any of the Android applications.
* Supports all Android versions.
* Supports Phonetic keyboard.
* Shows live preview to see the text typed in tamil. 

It should be noted that, Android OS still dont have tamil unicode support. To view tamil we recommend Opera browser which renders tamil script in server and sends as bitmap. And use Tamilvisai to type text.

Android Tamilvisa can be downloaded in the following URL also: "Android Tamilvisa can be downloaded in the following URL also:http://www.appbrain.com/app/tamil-visai/com.tamil.visai
